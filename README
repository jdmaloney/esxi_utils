Clone_VM:
Script to clone an existing Virtual Machine in ESXI.  Make sure VM is shutdown before cloning.  Currently script only clones to the same host, with support for cloning to a different host forthcoming.  Script is set to run from a non-ESXI host (jump host, admin node, etc.).  Ensure that SSH keys are enbaled between the admin node and ESXI Hypervisor and that SSH is enabled on both hosts.  It is advised to limit SSH access on ESXI to a set range of IP addresses for security
